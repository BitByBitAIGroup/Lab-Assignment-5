## Abstract
Graphical models are a powerful tool for reasoning
under uncertainty. They are used to represent and reason
about probability distributions over a set of random variables.
A Bayesian network is a graphical model that encodes the
probability of a set of random variables. It consists of a directed
acyclic graph (DAG) with nodes representing random variables
and arrows representing statistical relationships between the
variables. Bayesian networks can be used to generate predictions
from data, infer the probabilistic relationships between variables,
and learn the structure and conditional probability tables (CPTs)
from data. Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on
Bayesian networks. It assumes that the features of a given data
point are conditionally independent of each other, given the
class label. This simplifies the model and makes it easier to
learn from data. However, if there are dependencies between
features, the accuracy of naive Bayes can be improved by
taking these into account. This lab will explore graphical models,
Bayesian networks, and naive Bayes classification. It will learn the
structure and CPTs from data, understand the graphical models
for inference under uncertainty, and build Bayesian networks in
R. The results of this project can be used to improve the accuracy
of naive Bayes classification when there are dependencies between
features.

## Aim

- understand the graphical models for inference under uncertainty 
-  build Bayesian Network in R
- Learn the structure and
CPTs from Data
- naive Bayes classification with dependency
between features

## Theory
Graphical models have become an increasingly popular
tool for dealing with uncertainty in various fields. These
models are particularly useful when dealing with complex
systems where the relationships between variables are not well
understood or when the relationships are uncertain. Among the
graphical models, Bayesian networks are particularly powerful
and widely used.
A Bayesian network is a graphical model that encodes the
probability of a set of random variables. The model consists
of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each node represents a random variable, and arrows represent the statistical
relationships between variables. Bayesian networks can be
used to generate predictions from data, infer the probabilistic
relationships between variables, and learn the structure and
conditional probability tables (CPTs) from data.
One of the most popular applications of Bayesian networks
is in classification tasks, where the goal is to assign a given
data point to a pre-defined class. Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on Bayesian networks that assumes
conditional independence between the features of a given data
point, given the class label. While this simplifies the model
and makes it easier to learn from data, it can limit its accuracy
when dependencies between features exist.
This lab explores the concepts of graphical models,
Bayesian networks, and naive Bayes classification. It will
cover the process of learning the structure and CPTs from data,
as well as understanding the graphical models for inference
under uncertainty. We will also learn how to build Bayesian
networks in R and use them for classification tasks.
## Conclusion
A Bayesian network is built to learn the dependencies
between courses using the Hill-Climbing algorithm and K2
score metric. The Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs)
for each course node are learned using the Bayesian
network and the available data. In conclusion, by building
a Bayesian network and analyzing the CPTs, we can learn
the dependencies between courses and understand how
grades in one course affect the grades in other courses. This
information can be used to design better educational policies
and programs to improve studentsâ€™ academic performance.
